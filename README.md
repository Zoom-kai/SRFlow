<br><br>

## Setup the Environment and start the Demo

<br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreas128/SRFlow.git && cd SRFlow && ./setup.sh
```

<br>

This oneliner will:
- Clone SRFlow
- Setup a python3 virtual env
- Install the packages from `requirements.txt`
- Download the pretrained models
- Download the validation data
- Run the Demo Jupyter Notebook

If you want to install it manually, read the `setup.sh` file. (Links to data/models, pip packages)

## Start the Demo once everything is setup

```bash
./run_jupyter.sh
```

## Reproduce the SRFlow Results

```
source myenv/bin/activate                      # Use the env you created using setup.sh
cd code
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 python test.py ./confs/SRFlow_DF2K_4X.yml      # Diverse Images 4X (Dataset Included)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 python test.py ./confs/SRFlow_DF2K_8X.yml      # Diverse Images 8X (Dataset Included)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 python test.py ./confs/SRFlow_CelebA_8X.yml    # Faces 8X
```
For testing, we apply SRFlow to the full images on CPU.

# Our paper explains

- **How to train Conditional Normalizing Flow** <br>
  We designed an architecture that archives state-of-the-art super-resolution quality.
- **How to train Normalizing Flow on a single GPU**  <br>
  We based our network on GLOW, which uses up to 40 GPUs to train for image generation. SRFlow only needs a single GPU for training conditional image generation.
- **How to use Normalizing Flow for image manipulation**  <br>
  How to exploit the latent space for Normalizing Flow for controlled image manipulations
- **See many Visual Results**  <br>
  Compare GAN vs Normalizing Flow yourself. We've included a lot of visuals results in our [[Paper]](https://bit.ly/2D9cN0L).

# Why I stopped usingÂ GAN - Blog

- **Sampling:** SRFlow outputs many different images for a single input.
- **Stable Training:** SRFlow has much fewer hyperparameters than GAN approaches, and we did not encounter training stability issues.
- **Convergence:** While GANs cannot converge, conditional Normalizing Flows converge monotonic and stable.
- **Higher Consistency:** When downsampling the super-resolution, one obtains almost the exact input.

# Code

Due to legal hurdles, we are not yet able to release the training code. Hope we can do so soon!

We use many components of https://github.com/chaiyujin/glow-pytorch and https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.
Thanks a lot!
